The **Excel Spreadsheet (XLS) file format** has the **.xls** extension.
This file type originates from [Microsoft
Excel](Microsoft_Excel "wikilink"). However, other spreadsheet software
can be used to display these files as well. These include:

- [WordPerfect](WordPerfect "wikilink")
- [OpenOffice](OpenOffice "wikilink")

The XLS file format should not be confused with [XLSX](XLSX "wikilink")
and [XSLB](XSLB "wikilink").

## MIME types

The following [MIME types](MIME_types "wikilink") apply to this [file
format](file_format "wikilink"):

- application/msexcel
- application/xls

## File signature

[Microsoft Excel](Microsoft_Excel "wikilink") spreadsheets of version
97-2003 use the [OLE Compound File](OLE_Compound_File "wikilink")
(OLECF). These files therefore have the OLECF file signature

The object stream of the OLECF containing a Excel spreadsheet contains
the string "..." with some version.

The Excel 97-2007 Binary File format is stored in the OLECF using

## Encryption

See [Word Document (DOC)](Word_Document_(DOC) "wikilink"). Note: perhaps
this section should be moved to a separate section about Microsoft
Office encryption
