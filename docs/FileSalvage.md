FileSalvage is a application by [SubRosaSoft
Inc.](SubRosaSoft_Inc. "wikilink") for exploring and recovering deleted
files from a drive or volume. It is designed to restore files that have:

- Been accidentally deleted.
- Become unreadable due to media faults.
- Been stored on a drive before it was re-initialized/formatted.

Sample applications include using this tool to recover iTunes libraries
or iPhoto collections. The program is device and file system
independent, meaning the user can recover files from a normal Mac OS
hard drive, USB key, PC disk, [Linux](Linux "wikilink") disk,
[FAT32](FAT32 "wikilink") disk, FLASH card, scratched CD, Digital
Cameras, iPods, and almost any other media or file system that can be
recognized in Mac OS X.

[FileSalvage](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=1)
also supports the ability to process disk images. This means that
defense attorney's, law enforcement and corporate agencies can now
access [EnCase](EnCase "wikilink")Â® (unencrypted images only), Unix DDM
and
[CopyCatX](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=7)
image file systems without purchasing expensive computer forensics
software.

And so, even with its advanced features and performance,
[FileSalvage](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=1)
is extremely straightforward to handle. The easy-to-use interface is
