**Twofish** is an [encryption](encryption "wikilink") algorithm designed
designed by [Bruce Schneier](Bruce_Schneier "wikilink"), John Kelsey,
Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson, Eli Biham
and Lars Knudsen as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard
[AES](AES "wikilink") competition, where it got third place with 31
votes ([Rijndael](Rijndael "wikilink") got 86 votes, and was selected by
[NIST](NIST "wikilink") as the [AES](AES "wikilink"), and
[Serpent](Serpent "wikilink") got 59 votes).

Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits
and key sizes up to 256 bits. It is related to the earlier
[Blowfish](Blowfish "wikilink") block cipher, also designed by [Bruce
Schneier](Bruce_Schneier "wikilink").
