The **Excel Spreadsheet (XLSX) file format** has the **.xlsb**
extension. This file type originates from [Microsoft
Excel](Microsoft_Excel "wikilink"). However, other spreadsheet software
can be used to display these files as well. These include:

- [OpenOffice](OpenOffice "wikilink") (probably as of version 3)

## MIME types

## File signature
