## Definition

### From Wikipedia ([<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Test_Action_Group>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Test_Action_Group)):

Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) is the common name for what was later
standardized as the IEEE 1149.1 Standard Test Access Port and
Boundary-Scan Architecture. It was initially devised for testing printed
circuit boards using boundary scan and is still widely used for this
application. Today JTAG is also widely used for IC debug ports. In the
embedded processor market, essentially all modern processors support
JTAG when they have enough pins. Embedded systems development relies on
debuggers talking to chips with JTAG to perform operations like single
stepping and breakpointing. Digital electronics products such as cell
phones or a wireless access point generally have no other debug or test
interfaces.

### Forensic Application

JTAG forensics is an acquisition procedure which involves connecting to
the Standard Test Access Port (TAPs) on a device and instructing the
processor to transfer the raw data stored on connected memory chips.
Jtagging supported phones can be an extremely effective technique to
extract a full physical image from devices that cannot be acquired by
other means.
