**Multihashing** is the process of using two or more
[hashing](hashing "wikilink") algorithms together. The exact origin of
the idea is unknown, but the first documented use of multihashing was
the [National Software Reference
Library](National_Software_Reference_Library "wikilink"). The process is
now used in a wide variety of tools, including
[hash](Hash_(Maresware) "wikilink") by Mares, [fsum](fsum "wikilink"),
[hashdeep](hashdeep "wikilink"), and [fciv](fciv "wikilink").
