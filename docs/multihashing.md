**Multihashing** is the process of using two or more
[hashing](hashing.md) algorithms together. The exact origin of
the idea is unknown, but the first documented use of multihashing was
the [National Software Reference
Library](national_software_reference_library.md). The process is
now used in a wide variety of tools, including
[hash](hash_(maresware).md) by Mares, [fsum](fsum "wikilink"),
[hashdeep](hashdeep.md), and [fciv](fciv "wikilink").
