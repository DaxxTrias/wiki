The Volatools suite is a set of tools by [Komoku](komoku.md) for
conducting [memory analysis](windows_memory_analysis.md). The
current version, **Volatools Basic**, can process images from [Windows
XP](windows_xp.md) Service Pack 2 systems. A forthcoming version
**Volatools Professional** should be able to process images from more
platforms. Although the Volatools are written in
[Python](python.md) and are therefore cross-platform, they
require the [Pykvm](pykvm.md) library that is only available for
[Windows](windows.md).

## License

The Volatools are licensed under the [GPL](:category:gpl.md).
Some of the functionality for these tools is contained in a closed
source library called [Pykvm](pykvm.md).

## History

Volatools Basic was first released at the [Blackhat
Federal](blackhat_(conference).md) conference in February 2007.
The professional version and an acquisition product, **Komoku
Acquisition Suite** are scheduled to be released in 2007.
