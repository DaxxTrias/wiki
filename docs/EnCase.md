**EnCase** is a family of all-in-one computer forensics suites sold by
[Guidance Software](Guidance_Software "wikilink"). These products
include EnCase Enterprise, EnCase Forensic Edition, EnCase eDiscovery,
and EnCase Lab Edition. These programs use a proprietary image file
format that has been reverse engineered. Users can create scripts,
called [EnScripts](EnScripts "wikilink"), to automate tasks.

## History

Expert Witness (for Windows) was the original name for EnCase (dating
back to 1998). More info about this can be found on the Internet Archive

## File Format

See [Encase image file format](Encase_image_file_format "wikilink")

## Hash Databases

EnCase uses [MD5](MD5 "wikilink") hashes and stores them in its
proprietary [Encase hash file format](Encase_hash_files "wikilink");
either individually or in a "hash map". EnCase supports importing hashes
from the [NSRL](National_Software_Reference_Library "wikilink"),
[Hashkeeper](Hashkeeper "wikilink"), and plain MD5 files.
