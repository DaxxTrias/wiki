## Forensic Issues

- Helix3 Pro can automount some storage devices like firewire devices
  and MMC in read/write mode;
- Helix3 Pro relies on file system drivers to provide write protection,
  mounting some file system types (e.g. [XFS](XFS "wikilink")) will
  result in several data writes to the original media.
