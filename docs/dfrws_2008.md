DFRWS is pleased to announce the release of the 2008 Forensic Challenge
and would like to remind you that paper submissions are due by March 17,
2008. We are also looking for corporate sponsorships for the conference.

## Challenge

The DFRWS 2008 Challenge focuses on the development of Linux memory
analysis techniques and the fusion of evidence from memory, hard disk,
and network. Since the DFRWS 2005 Challenge, there has been significant
progress in Windows memory analysis. Now, we are focusing on Linux and
on integrating evidence from multiple sources.

## About DFRWS

The 8th Annual DFRWS Conference is being held August 13-15, 2008 in
Baltimore, MD. The DFRWS Conference brings together leading researchers,
developers, practitioners, and educators interested in advancing the
state of the art in digital forensics from around the world. As the most
established venue in the field, DFRWS is the preferred place to present
both cutting-edge research and perspectives on best practices for all
aspects of digital forensics. As an independent organization, we promote
open community discussions and disseminate the results of our work to
the widest audience.
