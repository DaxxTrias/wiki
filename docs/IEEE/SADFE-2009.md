IEEE/SADFE-2009

4th International Workshop on Systematic Approaches to Digital Forensic
Engineering (IEEE/SADFE)

Thursday, May 21, 2009, The Claremont Resort, Oakland, California

Sponsored by the IEEE Technical Committee on Security and Privacy Held
in conjunction with the 2009 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy

Call for Papers Deadline: March 25, 2009

<http://conf.ncku.edu.tw/sadfe/sadfe09/cfp.html>

aper submissions due: Mar. 25, 2009 (this is an extended date, and is
now firm) Decisions by: Apr. 15, 2009

The IEEE/SADFE (Systematic Approaches to Digital Forensic Engineering)
International Workshop promotes systematic approaches to computer
investigations, by furthering the advancement of digital forensic
engineering as a disciplined practice.

Most previous SADFE papers have emphasized cyber crime investigations,
and this is still a key focus of the meeting.  However, we also welcome
papers on forensics that do not necessarily involve a crime:   general
attack analysis, insider threat, insurance and compliance
investigations, and similar forms of retrospective analysis are all
viable topics. Digital forensic engineering is characterized by the
application of scientific and mathematical principles to the
investigation and establishment of facts or evidence, either for use
within a court of law or to aid in understanding past events on a
computer system.

Past speakers and attendees of SADFE have included computer scientists,
social scientists, forensic practitioners, law enforcement, lawyers, and
judges. The synthesis of hard technology and science with social science
and practice forms the foundation of this conference.

Workshop Topics

The field of digital forensics faces many challenges, including scale,
scope and presentation or reintegration of primarily technical
information and conclusions into a non-technical societal framework.

Digital information now permeates cyber-crimes and cyber-enabled crimes.
 It may be available for only nanoseconds or for years; it may involve
only a single bit that has been modified, or huge volumes of data that
may be found locally or spread globally throughout a variety of
infrastructures. Correlating large amounts of digital information,
establishing relevance and reliability and authenticating electronic
evidence may be exceptionally difficult across geographically dispersed
public and proprietary platforms.

To advance the state of the art, IEEE/SADFE-2009 solicits broad-based,
innovative digital forensic engineering technology, techno-legal and
practice-related submissions in the following four areas:

Digital Data and Evidence Management: advanced digital evidence
discovery, collection, and storage

`   *   Identification, authentication and collection of digital evidence`
`    *   Post-collection handling of evidence and the preservation of data integrity`

`    *   Forensic-enabled architectures and processes, including network processes`
`    *   Managing geographically, politically and/or jurisdictionally dispersed data`
`    *   Data and web mining systems for identification and authentication of relevant data  `
`    `

Principle-based Digital Forensic Processes: systematic engineering
processes supporting digital evidence management which are sound on
scientific, technical and legal grounds

`   *   Legal and technical aspects of admissibility and evidence tests`

`    *   Innovative forensic engineering tools and applications`
`    *   Forensic-enabled support for incident response`
`    *   Forensic tool validation: methodologies and principles`
`    *   Legal and technical collaboration`

Instructions for Paper and Panel Submissions

The IEEE/SADFE-2009 Program Committee invites three types of
submissions:

Full papers

Full papers present mature research results. Papers accepted for
presentation at the Workshop will be included in the IEEE/SADFE-2009
proceedings, which will be published by IEEE Press following the
workshop.  This gives authors a chance to revise their submissions based
on feedback received during the workshop.  Full papers should be 8-12
pages when formatted according to IEEE 6x9, one-column guidelines
[1](http://www.computer.org/portal/site/cscps/menuitem.02df7cde46985ea21618fc2e6bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=cscps_level1&path=cscps/cps&file=cps_forms.xml&xsl=generic.xsl&;jsessionid=JPLBhvXvQppybVBYCp1wSjlJJ8L15DW1GRsLsvxTRl8gVnT7fz52!-551649330).
 Papers must include an abstract and a list of keywords, and clearly
indicate the corresponding author.

"Work-in-Progress" short papers

These shorter papers should describe interesting developing work or
concept in the field of digital forensic engineering. These papers
should emphasize the nature of the problem they present, potential
solution and implications/impacts to the field, in such a way that it
will engender community discussion. A selection of these papers will be
presented at IEEE/SADFE-2009 in a Works-in-Progress session.
Work-in-Progress papers should be 3-5 pages long. Work-in-Progress
papers will be included as an appendix in the IEEE/SADFE-2009
proceedings. Authors may participate in only one Work-in-Progress paper
(in the case of multiple submissions, later submissions will be
deleted).

Posters

Describing work in progress and/or specific tools available without
charge to the research community (ie, no vendor posters should be
submitted). Submissions must consist of a one-page abstract. Posters
will not be included in the proceedings.  There will be a session at the
workshop in which authors of selected posters will have individual
opportunities to briefly introduce their work during the meeting, and
will receive live feedback and questions on their work from members of
the program committee.

Each paper submission will be reviewed by at least three IEEE/SADFE-2009
Program Committee members. The selection process will be based on review
technical merits. Panel and posters decisions will be made by Program
Chair with recommendations from Program Committee and Steering
Committee.

Double Submissions, Uniqueness & Presentation

IEEE/SADFE-2009 is intended to support discussion and publication of
novel results. To meet this goal, submissions must not substantially
duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere. Work
submitted in parallel to any other conference or workshop with
proceedings is explicitly excluded from participation. If the work has
been submitted elsewhere in a venue that does not include proceedings,
the extent of the replication and the nature of the other venue should
be clearly indicated in a cover letter submitted along with the paper.
Finally, plagiarism has no place in the scholarly community and the
program committee reserves the right to notify employers and/or others
of any confirmed cases of plagiarism.

For accepted Full Papers, Posters, and for the Work-in-Progress, it is
required that at least one of the authors attends the conference to
present the paper.  The presenting author must be registered by the date
of the camera-ready submission.  The deadline for Work-in-Progress and
Full papers is the same.

All submissions (papers & panel proposals) must be submitted
electronically, following the instructions to be provided on the
IEEE/SADFE'09 website (http://conf.ncku.edu.tw/sadfe/sadfe09/). Papers
must list all authors and their affiliations; in case of multiple
authors, the contact author must be indicated.
