The **Automatic Fingerprint Identification System** (**AFIS**) is a
system that reports if two [fingerprints](fingerprint.md) are a
likely match (that is, made by the same finger) or not a likely match.

AFIS is not a digital forensics technique, but it is a forensic
technique that uses digital computers.
