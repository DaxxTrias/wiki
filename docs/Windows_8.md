Initially Windows 8 had a workstation and server edition. The server
edition became Windows Server 2012.

## New Features

The following new features were introduced in Windows 8:

- [File History](Windows_File_History "wikilink")
- [Storage Spaces](Windows_Storage_Spaces "wikilink")
- [Search Charm History](Search_Charm_History "wikilink")

## File System

The file system used by Windows 8 is primarily [NTFS](NTFS "wikilink").

The [Resilient File System
(ReFS)](Resilient_File_System_(ReFS) "wikilink") was initially available
in the Windows 8 server edition but became part of Windows 2012 server
edition.

## Jump Lists

[Jump Lists](Jump_Lists "wikilink") are Task Bar artifacts that were
first introduced on Windows 7 and are also available on Windows 8.

## [Prefetch](Prefetch "wikilink")

The prefetch hash function is similar to [Windows
2008](Windows_2008 "wikilink").

The [Windows Prefetch File
Format](Windows_Prefetch_File_Format "wikilink") was changed on Windows
8.1 to version 26. (note this could be Windows 8 as well but has not
been confirmed)

## Registry

The [Windows Registry](Windows_Registry "wikilink") remains a core
component of the Windows operating system.

## Application Experience and Compatibility

On Windows 8 Amcache.hve replaces RecentFileCache.bcf and uses the
[Windows NT Registry File
(REGF)](Windows_NT_Registry_File_(REGF) "wikilink") format. A common
location for Amcache.hve is:

    C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve
