CarvFs is a modular [Fuse](Fuse "wikilink") based user space file system
on top of [LibCarvPath](LibCarvPath "wikilink"). CarvFS makes CarvPath
style annotations as used by LibCarvPath available as files. Using
CarvFs makes it possible to process carved entities using [zero storage
carving](zero_storage_carving "wikilink").

CarvFs is modular with respect to access to image files. The CarvFs
distribution comes with a default module for access to [(split) raw
files](Raw_Image_Format "wikilink").

A separate [Libewf](Libewf "wikilink") module is available for access to
[EWF images](Encase_image_file_format "wikilink").

For use in computer forensic frameworks, CarvFS is superseded by the
closely related [MattockFS](MattockFS "wikilink").
