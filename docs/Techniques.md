Although the **techniques** for investigating [computer
forensics](computer_forensics "wikilink") are limited only by an
[investigator](investigator "wikilink")'s imagination, here are some
guidelines on tried and true methodologies.

## Techniques

- [Data Reduction](Data_Reduction "wikilink") - By eliminating
  information that doesn't matter, an investigator is left with
  information that does matter.
- [Locard's exchange principle](Locard's_exchange_principle "wikilink")

## Guidelines

- RFC 3227, "Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving," D.
  Brezinski and T. Killalea, February 2002.
