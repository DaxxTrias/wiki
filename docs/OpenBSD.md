**OpenBSD** is a [Unix](Unix "wikilink")-like operating system. It is
said to be very secure, so much so the authors can make the claim of
“Only two remote holes in the default install, in more than 10 years!”.
This claim is something very few [operating
systems](operating_systems "wikilink") can testify to.
