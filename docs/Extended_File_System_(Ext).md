The Extended File System (Ext) is a family of file systems consisting
of: ext, ext2, ext3, ext4

## Ext2

**ext2** or the **second extended file system** is a
[Linux](Linux "wikilink") filesystem designed as a replacement for ext.
Note that ext3 is mostly compatible with ext2.

## Ext3

**ext3** or the **third extended file system** is a
[Linux](Linux "wikilink") filesystem. Its main advantage over ext2 is
journalling which improves reliability and eliminates the need to check
the file system after an unclean shutdown.
