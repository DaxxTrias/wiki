The OnLine Digital Forensic Suite (OnLine DFS) is a suite of
applications for the investigation of live computers in networks.
OnLineDFS allows an investigator to gather [volatile
data](volatile_data "wikilink") from runnings systems, including process
lists, active network connections, open files, as well as process
memory, and files. The information is presented via a web-based user
interface allowing the investigator to be remotely located. All actions
taken by the investigator are maintained in a log file.

All acquired data is stored in the native format (e.g., memory or disk
images), XML, or plain text, to allow for interoperability.

The OnLineDFS server runs on a Windows platform, but supports analyzing
various operating systems, including Windows (NT, 2000, XP, 2003,
Vista), Linux (several distributions), Mac OSX, FreeBSD, and Solaris.
The web-based user interface can be displayed on most browsers.

Platform (MFP), as part of an Air Force SBIR grant and is now maintained
and sold by Cyber Security Technologies. OnLineDFS is distributed to US
law enforcement by WetStone Technologies as LiveWire Investigator.
