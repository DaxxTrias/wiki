Strings is a program that prints out any [ASCII](ASCII "wikilink") or
[Unicode](Unicode "wikilink") strings in the input file. Forensic
examiners can use strings to get a sense of the functionality of an
unknown program. User prompts, error messages, and status messages can
give hints, but should not be used as proof or lack or any
functionality.

Most [Linux](Linux "wikilink") distributions and other UNIX-like
operating systems have a strings program included. There is a
[Windows](Windows "wikilink") version of strings by
[Microsoft's](Microsoft "wikilink") [Mark
Russinovich](Mark_Russinovich "wikilink"). Note that the Windows version
prints an output header and searches for both ASCII and Unicode strings
by default.
