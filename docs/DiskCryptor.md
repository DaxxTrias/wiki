**DiskCryptor** is a free disk encryption solution provided under GNU
General Public License.

Old DiskCryptor versions were fully compatible with
[TrueCrypt](TrueCrypt "wikilink") since they used the same partition
format and encryption algorithm (AES-256 in LRW mode). The compatibility
was dropped since DiskCryptor 0.5 in order to make use of a more
advanced partition format.

The project also provides information about [some basic risks of using
cryptographic
software](http://diskcryptor.net/index.php/CryptoUsageRisks_en).
