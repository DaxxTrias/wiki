The **Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team** (**AFCERT**) was an
agency of the United States Air Force. It has since been moved into the
[Air Force Network Operations and Security Center Network Security
Division](Air_Force_Network_Operations_and_Security_Center_Network_Security_Division "wikilink")
(AFNOSC/NSD).
