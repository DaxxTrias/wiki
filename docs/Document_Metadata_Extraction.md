# General

These general-purpose programs frequently work when the special-purpose
programs fail, but they generally provide less detailed information.

[Metadact-e](Metadact-e "wikilink")
"Patented server-based metadata cleaning software that previews, cleans
and converts documents in Microsoft Outlook, Web Access email, tablets
and smartphones, as well as desktop-based documents."

documents, image files, sound files Microsoft office documents, and many
others."

[Directory Lister Pro](Directory_Lister_Pro "wikilink")
Directory Lister Pro is a Windows tool which creates listings of files
from selected directories on hard disks, CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, floppies,
USB storages and network shares. Listing can be in HTML, text or CSV
format (for easy import to Excel). Listing can contain standard file
information like file name, extension, type, owner and date created, but
especially for forensic analysis file meta data can be extracted from
various formats: 1) executable file information (EXE, DLL, OCX) like
file version, description, company, product name. 2) multimedia
properties (MP3, AVI, WAV, JPG, GIF, BMP, MKV, MKA, MPEG) like track,
title, artist, album, genre, video format, bits per pixel, frames per
second, audio format, bits per channel. 3) Microsoft Office files (DOC,
DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX) like document title, author, keywords, word
count. For each file and folder it is also possible to obtain its CRC32,
MD5, SHA-1 and Whirlpool hash sum. Extensive number of options allows to
completely customize the visual look of the output. Filter on file name,
date, size or attributes can be applied so it is possible to limit the
files listed.

[Apache Tika](Apache_Tika "wikilink")
Apache Tika extracts metadata from a wide range of file formats and
normalizes metadata keys to Dublin Core when possible. In recent
versions of Tika, we have focused on extracting more information about
"authors" (original author, comment authors, last-saved-by, editors,
etc.) in general formats and more granular information for to/from/bcc
info in .msg files. We've also added extraction of "original paths,"
when available, that might allow examiners to see the full path that the
file or its attachments were stored. Finally, we've enriched extraction
from XMP to allow identification of uuids and ancestor uuids. Tika can
run in batch mode from input directory to output directory, and we
recommend the RecursiveParserWrapper (-J -t options in the commandline
app or /rmeta endpoint in
[tika-server](https://wiki.apache.org/tika/TikaJAXRS)) to capture
metadata from embedded documents.
