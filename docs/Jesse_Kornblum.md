## Tools

[md5deep](md5deep "wikilink") and [hashdeep](hashdeep "wikilink") -
Cross platform recursive [hashing](hashing "wikilink") and auditing
programs, respectively. Computes MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, Tiger and
Whirlpool hashes. Can also match against sets of known hashes. The
latter program uses [multihashing](multihashing "wikilink") to conduct a
computer forensics audit.

[foremost](foremost "wikilink") - File [carving](carving "wikilink")
program

[ssdeep](ssdeep "wikilink") - Usually called Fuzzy Hashing, this program
implements [Context Triggered Piecewise
Hashing](Context_Triggered_Piecewise_Hashing "wikilink").

[FRED](First_Responder's_Evidence_Disk "wikilink") - The First
Responder's Evidence Disk

[dc3dd](dc3dd "wikilink") - A patch to add forensics features to [GNU
dd](dd "wikilink")

[Miss Identify](Miss_Identify "wikilink") - Program to identify Win32
executables that don't have an executable extension. Can also identify
all executables.
