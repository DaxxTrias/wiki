**FFS** is one name given to the BSD **Fast File System**, also known as
**UFS1** or **UFS2** (referring to different versions of the file
system). Modern FFS implementations are used in many systems based on
4.2BSD, 4.3BSD and 4.4BSD, including [FreeBSD](FreeBSD "wikilink"),
[OpenBSD](OpenBSD "wikilink"), and [NetBSD](NetBSD "wikilink"). Variants
and derivative file systems are also in use on other platforms,
including [Solaris](Solaris "wikilink"). Many differences in terms of
capabilities and metadata exist between these systems, and compatibility
is not guaranteed.

*Note: This article refers to the BSD Fast File System. For information
on the Amiga Fast File System, please see [Ffs
(Amiga)](Ffs_(Amiga) "wikilink").*
