The **Forensic Toolkit** (**FTK**) is a commercial forensic software
package distributed by [AccessData](accessdata.md).

# Features

The Forensic toolkit can parse a number of filesystems, including
[FAT](fat.md) 12/16/32, [NTFS](NTFS "wikilink"), NTFS
Compressed, [Ext2](ext2.md), and [Ext3](Ext3 "wikilink"). It can
use image files created by [AFF](aff.md),
[EnCase](encase.md), [SMART](SMART "wikilink"),
[Snapback](snapback.md), some versions of
[Safeback](safeback.md) and [dd](dd "wikilink").

The program allows users to search with keywords or take advantage of
[drive indexing](drive_indexing.md) using the
[dtSearch](dtsearch.md) algorithm.

## Data Reduction

The Known File Filter, or KFF, can be used to eliminate or highlight
known files using [MD5](md5.md) hashes generated by user or from
[NIST](national_software_reference_library.md) or
[Hashkeeper](hashkeeper.md).
