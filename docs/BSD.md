**Berkeley Software Distribution** (**BSD**) is one of the three major
derivates of the [Unix](Unix "wikilink") [operating
system](operating_system "wikilink") from which many versions have been
created such as [OpenBSD](OpenBSD "wikilink"),
[FreeBSD](FreeBSD "wikilink"), [NetBSD](NetBSD "wikilink"), [Trusted
BSD](Trusted_BSD "wikilink"), and very early versions of
[Sun](Sun "wikilink")â€™s [Solaris](Solaris "wikilink"). BSD was first
released in the late 1970s and continues to have a strong following
today exhibited in the continued existence of the above versions. The
only exception is Sun who switched the design of their operating system
over to [System V](System_V "wikilink") Release 4.
