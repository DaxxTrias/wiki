The [Fernico](fernico.md) ZRT Cell Phone Examination tool is a
manual examination and reporting tool for cell phones. It reportedly
takes photograph of the screen and merges those photos into custom
designed report templates. Because it is a physical capture device, it
will not work with devices that are locked for which no password or
exploit is known.

ZRT allows investigators to pull data off a mobile device when all other
tools wonâ€™t work. Still displays, video and audio can be extracted using
ZRT. It can save investigators days of work time in manually acquiring a
mobile device. In one click, ZRT will also produce a professional custom
report that includes all evidence obtained from the mobile device.
