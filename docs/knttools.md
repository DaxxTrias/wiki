KnTTools, developed by [GMG Systems Inc.](gmg_systems_inc..md)
is a suite of command-line tools designed for
[Windows](windows.md) [memory
acquisition](tools:memory_imaging.md) and [memory
analysis](windows_memory_analysis.md). One of the components of
KnTTools, [KnTList](kntlist.md), was used in the 2005
[DFRWS](digital_forensic_research_workshop.md) Memory Analysis
Challenge. Another tool, [Kntdd](kntdd.md), can be used to image
physical memory.

There are two versions of the suite, Basic and Enterprise editions.

The programs are sold with a separate End User License Agreement (EULA)
for each program.
