**3DES** or **Triple DES** is a block cipher formed by using the Data
Encryption Standard ([DES](DES "wikilink")) cipher three times.

3DES is typically implemented as ENCRYPT(block,K1), DECRYPT(block,K2),
ENCRYPT(block,K3). This way, if you set K1==K2 it's backwards compatible
with single-key DES with K3. It's pretty cool, but perhaps less useful
today than it was when 3DES was first brought out.
