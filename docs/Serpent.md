**Serpent** is an [encryption](encryption "wikilink") algorithm designed
by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen as a candidate for the
Advanced Encryption Standard [AES](AES "wikilink") competition, where it
got second place with 59 votes ([Rijndael](Rijndael "wikilink") got 86
votes, and was selected by [NIST](NIST "wikilink") as the
[AES](AES "wikilink")).

Serpent uses a block size of 128 bits and supports a key size of 128,
192 or 256 bits.

Serpent and Rijndael are somewhat similar. The main difference is that
Rijndael has fewer rounds (10, 12 or 14 (depending on key size) compared
to 32 for Serpent), hence it is faster. Arguably, Serpent is more
secure.

Serpent is available as public domain, and can be freely used by anyone.
