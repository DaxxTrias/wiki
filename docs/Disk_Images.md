There are various types of disk image formats. For clarity the formats
are divided by means of their original purpose, e.g. were they intended
to be used in (disk) forensics or virtualization.

Disk images are usually block by block copies of the original data
source. Depending on the data source, the blocks can be bytes, sectors,
clusters, pages or similar. The disk image format may be further
enhanced with additional information, such as error detection, error
correction, data digest ([hash](hash "wikilink")), and compression.
