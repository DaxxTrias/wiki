AutopsyÂ® is an easy to use, GUI-based program that allows you to
efficiently analyze hard drives and smart phones. It has a plug-in
architecture that allows you to find add-on modules or develop custom
modules in Java or Python.

**Autopsy** uses [The Sleuth Kit](The_Sleuth_Kit "wikilink") for file
system analysis. It can analyze [Windows](Windows "wikilink"),
[MacOS](MacOS "wikilink"), and [UNIX](UNIX "wikilink") disks, as well as
cell phone dumps and collections of individual files. There are many
third-party plug-in modules.
