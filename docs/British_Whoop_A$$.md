British Whoop A\$\$ (southern London pronunciation \[wup-ass\] Northern
England pronunciation \[whip-ass\]) has two common meanings.

In the [United Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) and
some
[Commonwealth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations)
countries, whoop a\$\$ refers to both

1- a bland, near tasteless pudding dishes such as
[Tapioca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapioca) pudding or [rice
pudding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_pudding) and rich, fairly
homogeneous starch or dairy-based desserts such as rice pudding and
[Christmas pudding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_pudding) and

2- a colloquialism used as a synonym for mild, half hearted spanking
accompanied by non-offensive verbal trash talk in a British accent.

Opening a can of British Whoop A\$\$ is not dangerous but has been known
to induce laughter from American
[forensicators](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Forensicator)
and occasionally a mild rash.

Scientific note: No "a\$\$" is actually harmed in a British whoop a\$\$.
