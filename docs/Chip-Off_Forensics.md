### Forensic Application

Chip-off forensics is an acquisition procedure which involves physically
removing the non-volatile integrated circuit (IC) from a device and
reading it directly on an external specialized reader. It is often
considered a last-option technique, as repairing the phone to a working
state post-IC removal, is difficult.
