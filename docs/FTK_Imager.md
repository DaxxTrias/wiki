The **Forensic Toolkit Imager** (**FTK Imager**) is a commercial
forensic [imaging](imaging "wikilink") software package distributed by
[AccessData](AccessData "wikilink").

FTK Imager supports storage of disk images in EnCase's or
[SMART](SMART "wikilink")'s file format, as well as in raw
([dd](dd "wikilink")) format. With Isobuster technology built in, [FTK
Imager](FTK_Imager "wikilink") Images CD's to a
ISO/[CUE](CUE_Sheet_format "wikilink") file combination. This also
includes multi and open session CDs.

## Notes

- **Important**: when using FTK Imager to create a forensic image of a
  suspect's [hard drive](hard_drive "wikilink"), make sure you are using
  a hardware-based [write blocking device](Write_Blockers "wikilink").
  This ensures that your [operating system](operating_system "wikilink")
  does not alter the suspect's hard drive when you attach the drive to
  your computer.
