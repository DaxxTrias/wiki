**aimage** (the **advanced imager**) was an
[imaging](imaging "wikilink") tool that was part of
[AFF](AFF "wikilink").

**aimage** can create files in raw, AFF, AFD, or AFM formats. AFF and
AFD formats can be compressed or uncompressed.
[aimage](aimage "wikilink") can optionally compress and calculate
[MD5](MD5 "wikilink") or [SHA-1](SHA-1 "wikilink") hash residues while
the data is being copied. It had intelligent error recovery, similar to
what is in [ddrescue](ddrescue "wikilink").

*'aimage* was withdrawn from support (December 25, 2010)

Linux distributions that packaged **image** are encouraged to drop it
and package guymager instead.
