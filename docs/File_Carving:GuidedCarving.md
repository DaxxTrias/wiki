**GuidedCarving** is a [File Carving](File_Carving "wikilink") technique
to recover fragmented files introduced in [Adroit Photo
Forensics](Adroit_Photo_Forensics "wikilink"). GuidedCarving allows a
user to attempt to recover a fragmented file that failed to fully
recover using [SmartCarving](File_Carving:SmartCarving "wikilink").

## Process

- The user opens a photo that has failed to recover properly.
- The user identifies the first error on a photo by clicking on it.
- [Adroit Photo Forensics](Adroit_Photo_Forensics "wikilink") then
  presents the user with the best possible block matches.
- The user cycles through the presented blocks to find the correct
  continuation block.
- User can then choose to either manually build the rest of the file or
  allow [SmartCarving](File_Carving:SmartCarving "wikilink") to take
  over again.
