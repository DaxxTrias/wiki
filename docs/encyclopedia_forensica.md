Encyclopedia is defined as - An encyclopedia is a type of reference work
â€“ a compendium holding a summary of information from either all branches
of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge (Wikipedia). This page
and its linked contents will attempt to divide into sections the known
corpus of computer forensic knowledge in regards to operating system
artifacts. Once competed, and likely during, the goal of this project is
to define what is known and what is still unknown so that we can begin
to map out those unknown areas for future research.

document them
