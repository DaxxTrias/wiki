## Overview

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution, using Unity as the default desktop
environment. It is based on [Debian](Debian "wikilink"), which is
another Linux distribution. Since it is widely used, many forensic tools
function on it. Some teams have built forensic workstations on top of
it.

## Forensic Integration

The SANS Incident Forensic Toolkit (SIFT) was built on top of Ubuntu. It
has many tools preinstalled on it including:

`   The Sleuth Kit`
`   Wireshark`
`   HexEditor`
`   Pasco`
`   md5deep`
`   ssdeep`
`   Volatility Framework`
