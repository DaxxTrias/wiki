**Paraben's Device Seizure** is a handheld device for capturing the data
on cell phones and PDAs. It uses a physical acquisition method. It
supports phones made by LG, Motorola (including the
[iDen](iDen "wikilink")), Nokia, Siemens, Samsung, Sony-Ericsson, and
the [iPhone](iPhone "wikilink"), although the amount of data acquired
from the iPhone plug-in can vary depending on the version of the
operating system and whether the phone has been unlocked using
Jailbreaking software. The tool also supports GSM SIM cards with use of
a SIM card reader. [Paraben](Paraben "wikilink") also sells such
products.

The tool also supports PDAs running Palm OS, Windows CE, Pocket PC, and
Windows Mobile, Blackberry, Symbian, and EPOC, although not all versions
of all operating systems are supported.

The vendor claims the product can recover data from
[Garmin](Garmin "wikilink") [GPS](GPS "wikilink") devices, but this has
not yet been verified.
