**Scalpel** is an [open source](open_source "wikilink") program for
[recovering deleted data](recovering_deleted_data "wikilink") originally
based on [foremost](foremost "wikilink"), although significantly more
efficient. Originally developed by [Golden G. Richard
III](Golden_G._Richard_III "wikilink") and presented at the
[DFRWS](Digital_Forensic_Research_Workshop "wikilink") conference in
2005, it allows an examiner to specify a number of headers and footers
to recover filetypes from a piece of media. Scalpel is maintained by
[Golden G. Richard III](Golden_G._Richard_III "wikilink") and [Lodovico
Marziale](Lodovico_Marziale "wikilink"). Currently, Scalpel is being
incorporated into the [Sleuthkit](Sleuthkit "wikilink") (TSK) and is now
hosted on GitHub.
