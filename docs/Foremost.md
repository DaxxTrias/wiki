**Foremost** is a [Linux](Linux "wikilink") based program data for
[recovering deleted files](Recovering_deleted_data "wikilink") and
served as the basis for the more modern [Scalpel](Scalpel "wikilink").
The program uses a configuration file to specify [headers and
footers](File_Formats "wikilink") to search for. Intended to be run on
[disk images](disk_image "wikilink"), foremost can search through most
any kind of data without worrying about the format.

## History

Foremost was developed by [Jesse Kornblum](Jesse_Kornblum "wikilink")
and [Kris Kendall](Kris_Kendall "wikilink") when they served in the [Air
Force Office of Special
Investigations](Air_Force_Office_of_Special_Investigations "wikilink").
Originally designed to imitate the [Defense Computer Forensics
Lab's](Defense_Computer_Forensics_Lab "wikilink")
**[carvthis](carvthis "wikilink")** program, it gained popularity among
Air Force investigators and was eventually distributed to the general
public.

First published in 2000, a major update was released in 2005 when [Nick
Mikus](Nick_Mikus "wikilink") joined the project.

## Spinoffs

Foremost served as the basis for [Golden G. Richard
III's](Golden_G._Richard_III "wikilink") [Scalpel](Scalpel "wikilink"),
a significantly faster program to also recover [deleted
files](deleted_files "wikilink"). It has also inspired
[tcpxtract](tcpxtract "wikilink"), a program for extracting file from
network traffic.

Foremost's authors have recommended that practitioners use
[Scalpel](Scalpel "wikilink") instead of Foremost.

## Limitations

Due to programming difficulties, foremost is limited to processing files
smaller than 2GB.
