**OS fingerprinting** is the process of determining the [operating
system](operating_system "wikilink") used by a host on a network.

## Active fingerprinting

Active fingerprinting is the process of transmitting packets to a remote
host and analysing corresponding replies.

## Passive fingerprinting

Passive fingerprinting is the process of analysing packets from a host
on a network. In this case, fingerprinter acts as a
[sniffer](sniffer "wikilink") and doesn't put any traffic on a network.

## Fingerprinting techniques

Almost all fingerprinting techniques are based on detecting difference
in packets generated by different operating systems.

Common techniques are based on analysing:

- IP TTL values;
- IP ID values;
- TCP Window size;
- TCP Options (generally, in TCP SYN and SYN+ACK packets);
- DHCP requests;
- ICMP requests;
- HTTP packets (generally, User-Agent field).

Other techniques are based on analysing:

- Running services;
- Open port patterns.

## Limitations

Many passive fingerprinters are getting confused when analysing packets
from a NAT device.

## Tools

Active fingerprinters:

- [Nmap](Nmap "wikilink")

Passive fingerprinters:

- [NetworkMiner](NetworkMiner "wikilink")
- [p0f](p0f "wikilink")
- [Satori](Satori "wikilink")
