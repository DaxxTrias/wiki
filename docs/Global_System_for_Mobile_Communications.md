The **Global Systems for Mobile Communications** (**GSM**), is a
radio-based technology that allows [mobile
phones](mobile_phones "wikilink") to communicate. GSM is considered to
be the world's most ubiquitous radio-based cellular technology, with 1.7
billion users as of March 2006. In the United States, carriers such as
[T-Mobile](T-Mobile "wikilink") and [Cingular](Cingular "wikilink")
utilize GSM technology for their cellular networks.

# Operational Characteristics

## Network Principles

GSM is considered to be 2G and uses digital data for both signaling and
voice purposes. GSM uses a time division multiple access
([TDMA](TDMA "wikilink")) protocol to transmit information. Aside from
voice, [GPRS](GPRS "wikilink") and [EDGE](EDGE "wikilink") allow for
data transmissions across a GSM network.

## Radio Communication

In terms of frequencies used, GSM networks often use the 900MHz and
1800MHz bands, but carriers in the United States use 850MHz and 1900MHz
bands. As a result, "dual-band" phones, which only support two of the
four major bands, can only be used in certain parts of the world. More
common are "tri-band" phones, which usually operate on 900/1800MHz and
1900MHz. "Quad-band" phones support all four frequencies and can be used
in all parts of the world.

## Security and Encryption

- [SIM Card](SIM_Card "wikilink")
- [Security Standards](Security_Standards "wikilink")
- [Authentication Standards](Authentication_Standards "wikilink")

# GSM Forensics

For phones with a SIM card, perform forensics on the cell phone before
removing the SIM Card.
