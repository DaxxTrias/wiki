The Volatools suite is a set of tools by [Komoku](Komoku "wikilink") for
conducting [memory analysis](Windows_Memory_Analysis "wikilink"). The
current version, **Volatools Basic**, can process images from [Windows
XP](Windows_XP "wikilink") Service Pack 2 systems. A forthcoming version
**Volatools Professional** should be able to process images from more
platforms. Although the Volatools are written in
[Python](Python "wikilink") and are therefore cross-platform, they
require the [Pykvm](Pykvm "wikilink") library that is only available for
[Windows](Windows "wikilink").

## License

The Volatools are licensed under the [GPL](:Category:GPL "wikilink").
Some of the functionality for these tools is contained in a closed
source library called [Pykvm](Pykvm "wikilink").

## History

Volatools Basic was first released at the [Blackhat
Federal](Blackhat_(conference) "wikilink") conference in February 2007.
The professional version and an acquisition product, **Komoku
Acquisition Suite** are scheduled to be released in 2007.
