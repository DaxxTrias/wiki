The **Integrated Digital Enhanced Network** (**iDEN**) is a proprietary
mobile communications technology from [Motorola](Motorola "wikilink").
It is a [TDMA](TDMA "wikilink") based digital wireless standard that
operates in the 800 MHz, 900MHz, and 1.5 GHz bands. It combines the
capabilities of a [digital cellular telephone](cell_phones "wikilink")
and a two-way radio known as [push-to-talk](push-to-talk "wikilink")
([PTT](PTT "wikilink")).

Motorolaâ€™s iDEN technology phones support many other features including
[Bluetooth](Bluetooth "wikilink"), location-based services,
[MOTOTalk](MOTOTalk "wikilink") and support for expandable memory
([Micro SD](Micro_SD "wikilink")). [Sprint
Nextel](Sprint_Nextel "wikilink") is the largest U.S. retailer of iDEN
services.

Newer iDEN phones use a [SIM card](SIM_card "wikilink") that is
compatible with [GSM](GSM "wikilink") phones for overseas roaming but
iDEN is a very different standard from GSM. iDEN phones are not
compatible with GSM networks and GSM phones are not compatible with iDEN
networks.

## History

iDEN was invented by Motorola who is presently the primary manufacturer
of iDEN devices.

[Nextel](Nextel "wikilink") has started to develop a 2.5G technology
called **WiDEN** (an expansion of iDEN) that includes four carriers
(100kHz) into one channel. This results in a much higher download speed
of 96 kbit/s.

## Software

Software for acquiring a iDEN data includes:

- [iDEN Companion Pro](iDEN_Companion_Pro "wikilink")
- [iDEN Media Downloader](iDEN_Media_Downloader "wikilink")
- [iDEN Phonebook Manager](iDEN_Phonebook_Manager "wikilink")
- [SIMiFOR](SIMiFOR "wikilink")
- [SIM Explorer](SIM_Explorer "wikilink")
