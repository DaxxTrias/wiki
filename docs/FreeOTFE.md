**FreeOTFE** is an open source program to create and mount virtual
encrypted disks in [Windows Vista/XP/2000](Windows "wikilink") and
[Linux](Linux "wikilink"). It provides two levels of plausible
deniability (hidden containers and no signatures to make differentiate
containers from random data), on the fly encryption and supports
numerous encryption algorithms (including [AES](AES "wikilink"),
[Blowfish](Blowfish "wikilink"), [Serpent](Serpent "wikilink") and
[Twofish](Twofish "wikilink")).

## Hidden volumes

A hidden volume is a volume concealed within the free space of another
FreeOTFE volume. Even when the outer volume is mounted, it is hard to
prove whether there is a hidden volume or not.

When a hidden volume is mounted, the operating system and third-party
applications may write to non-hidden volumes information about the data
stored in the hidden volume (e.g. most recently used
([MRU](MRU "wikilink")) lists).
