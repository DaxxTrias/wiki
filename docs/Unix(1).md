**Unix** or **UNIX** is a general-purpose multi-user [operating
system](operating_system "wikilink") developed mostly by [Ken
Thompson](Ken_Thompson "wikilink") and [Dennis
Ritchie](Dennis_Ritchie "wikilink") during 1969 at [Bell
Labs](Bell_Labs "wikilink"). About one year later during the early 1970s
UNIX was unveiled to the general public. The original goal as it is
today was to create a stable, secure, and powerful operating system that
is portable to many different hardware platforms.

Today UNIX has evolved into three main categories which all flavors of
UNIX derive from: [BSD](BSD "wikilink") (Berkley Software Distribution),
[System V](System_V "wikilink") Release 4, and hybrid. Some of the most
poplar flavors of UNIX are: [IBM](IBM "wikilink")’s
[AIX](AIX "wikilink"), [Sun Microsystems](Sun_Microsystems "wikilink")'
[Solaris](Solaris "wikilink"), [SGI](SGI "wikilink")’s
[IRIX](IRIX "wikilink"), [Linux](Linux "wikilink"),
[OpenBSD](OpenBSD "wikilink"), and [FreeBSD](FreeBSD "wikilink").
