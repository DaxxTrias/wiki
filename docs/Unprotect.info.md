**unprotect.info** is a software utility that can recover passwords to
the file-based [TrueCrypt](TrueCrypt "wikilink") volumes by using the
[brute-force](brute-force "wikilink") attack. **unprotect.info** runs on
[Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000](Windows "wikilink"). It is free for both
personal and commercial use.

## Supported encrypted volumes

**unprotect.info** can currently recover passwords to the volumes
encrypted with the following algorithms:

- Hash functions: [RIPEMD-160](RIPEMD-160 "wikilink"),
  [SHA-512](SHA-512 "wikilink"), [Whirlpool](Whirlpool "wikilink")
- Ciphers: [AES](AES "wikilink"), [Serpent](Serpent "wikilink"),
  [Twofish](Twofish "wikilink")
- Encryption modes: [XTS](XTS "wikilink")

## Unsupported encrypted volumes

If an encrypted volume was created with one of the following options,
its password currently cannot be recovered with the **unprotect.info**
software:

- Deprecated hash functions: [SHA1](SHA1 "wikilink")
- Deprecated ciphers: [DES](DES "wikilink"), [CAST](CAST "wikilink"),
  [Blowfish](Blowfish "wikilink")
- Deprecated encryption modes: [LWR](LWR "wikilink"),
  [CBC](CBC "wikilink")
- Combination encryption algorithms, such as: AES-Twofish, etc.
- Volumes encrypted with the [key files](key-file "wikilink")
- Hidden volumes, encrypted partitions, or encrypted drives.
