A **live CD** is a CD containing a bootable computer [operating
system](operating_system "wikilink"). Live CDs are widely used in
[computer forensics](computer_forensics "wikilink") and [incident
response](Incident_Response "wikilink").

## Advantages

- [Physical memory](Physical_memory "wikilink") of a computer can be
  imaged by performing cold boot attack without running tools on an
  untrusted [OS](OS "wikilink");
- Acquisition over a network connection without running tools on an
  untrusted [OS](OS "wikilink");
- No need to reconstruct [RAID](RAID "wikilink") arrays;
- etc.

## Disadvantages

- Out-of-date software;
- No simple way to reconfigure Live CD: you cannot easily rebuild *foo*
  to support *bar* (e.g. rebuild [Sleuthkit](Sleuthkit "wikilink") to
  support [AFF](AFF "wikilink")).
