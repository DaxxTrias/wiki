**iVPN.net** is a commercial VPN service focused on multihop
[VPN](VPN "wikilink") connections. Traffic is routed via multiple
OpenVPN and IPSec network links in multiple jurisditions to ensure
anonymity. [iVPN](iVPN "wikilink") also implements interface crowding to
direct an optimal number of client connections to a single interface to
increase crowding factors and make real time correlation of network
streams significantly more difficult. The [iVPN](iVPN "wikilink")
privacy policy explicitly claims that they do not log any data relating
to their customers activities.
