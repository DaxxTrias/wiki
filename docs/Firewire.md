**Firewire** is the popular name of hardware using the **IEEE1394**
standard for connecting to a host system. Much like
[USB](USB "wikilink"), Firewire is commonly used to attach storage
devices and other external media. Firewire connectivity is available for
a large variety of systems, and is frequently included by default in
many [Sun Microsystems](Sun_Microsystems "wikilink") and
[Apple](Apple "wikilink") workstation computers.

Some recent controversy centered around the development of a tool,
[here](http://www.storm.net.nz/projects/16) which is capable of dumping
a system's memory via a firewire port.
