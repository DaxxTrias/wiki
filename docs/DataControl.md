**DataControl** by [BitArmor](BitArmor "wikilink") provides integrated
and transparent file and folder encryption. The protection can be
extended to both fixed and removable media, including the boot disk.
Users can be required to authenticate either before or after booting to
access the protected data. The tool uses 128, 192, or 256-bit
[AES](AES "wikilink") encryption in either ECB, ESS-IV or Plumb-IV mode.
